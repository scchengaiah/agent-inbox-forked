This is a forked repo to setup local running version of Agent UI Inbox.

For getting started example, we have forked the agent interrupt example [here](https://github.com/scchengaiah/agent-inbox-langgraph-example-forked).

Start the interrupt example and then use it in the Agent UI Inbox configuration.
